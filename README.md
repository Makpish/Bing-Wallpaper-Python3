# Bing-Wallpaper-Use

This is my small code to make Bing picture of the day as your desktop wallpaper.
This code works for python 3.
You have to install python 3 packages like requests and bs4.
For any issue just let me know or email me at mymittal777@gmail.com


For ubuntu use use ubuntu code.
Tested on Ubuntu 16.


For windows use Windows code.
Tested on Windows 10.
For windows install "subprocess" python package too.
Maybe sometimes changes would be seen after restarting the pc or not at all.

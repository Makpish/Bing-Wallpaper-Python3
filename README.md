# Bing-Wallpaper-Use
This is my small code to make Bing picture of the day as your ubuntu desktop wallpaper.
This code works for python 3 only and is exclusively for ubuntu.
You should have to install python 3 packages like requests and bs4.
For any issue just let me know or email me at mymittal777@gmail.com

# Bing-Wallpaper-Use
This is my small code to make Bing picture of the day as your ubuntu desktop wallpaper
For this u should surely have python 3 and this is only for ubuntu.
u should have to install python 3 packages like requests and bs4
for now i would like u to keep the file and its folder (named Bing) on desktop
for any issue just let me know or email me at mymittal777@gmail.com
